/* The CALL macro.
*  Called as RetType ret = CALL(E)
*  The expression E will be evaluated. E must return a RetType. If the expression
*  returns blocked, yield, or sleep, the execution will return to the scheduler.
*  Used for calling functions that require returning execution to the scheduler
*  depending on the return type.
*
*  The return value of E is returned to 'ret' if it was not blocked, sleep, or
*  yield.

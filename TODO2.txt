Make scheduler take a function AND an argument

Differentiate when a RetType means it needs the scheduler

Figure out how init should work
- top level init function
- each device has an init function, added to scheduler by top level init
- make an init task for each device
- at the end of it's init task, it adds it's poll task to the scheduler
- potentially just make the same function
- "device daemon" or something
- make a way to template making that daemon
- how to know when init is complete??? that's when we should add the rest of the tasks
    - a way to signal when a task ends?

Things that still need doing:

• finish ARP layer
 - in net/arp
 - add reply functionality
 - add request functionality
 - allow tasks to block on waiting for an address to be populated (should have timeout too)

• add ICMP layer

• add simple networking stack
 - reference implementation (or usable in most cases)
 - socket router <--> UDP router <--> IPv4 router <--> Ethernet layer
                             ICMP <--/
 - can add a device below the stack that handles layer 1

• finish NIC driver
 - Wiznet W5500 chip
 - mostly care about using Socket 0 in raw mode

• add GPIO device abstraction
 - probably per pin, pins can be looked up by device string name
 - should just have a set and a get
